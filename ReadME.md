## Installation of Dependencies <a name="installation_of_dependencies">

This project uses the dependencies `pygame`, `moderngl`, `numpy`, and `supabase`, which are not built in to the Python system. To install these dependencies, you will have to use pip in your terminal if you are in a local environment.

1. ### Install `pip` if Needed
   1. First, get the `get-pip.py` file from the following link:  
   [https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)
   2. Run it in your local Python environment or alternatively use `cd` in your terminal to get into the file and run it with `python3`:
      
```Bash
cd /Directory/to/get-pip.py
python3 get-pip.py
```
> *NOTE:* Replace *"/Directory/to/get-pip.py"* with the actual directory to `get-pip.py`

2. ### Get Dependencies
Run the following commands in your terminal to install the dependencies using `pip`.

```Bash
pip install pygame supabase moderngl numpy
```

If that did not work, you can alternatively try these following commands:

```Bash
pip3 install pygame supabase moderngl numpy
```

> ***NOTE:*** These directions are assuming you are running Python verison 3 or higher.
